# Soul Drive

Soul Drive is a concept demo for an immersive 3D urban exploration and storytelling experience. It showcases a minimal prototype built with JavaScript, Three.js, and Tailwind CSS.

This project currently demonstrates:

- A basic 3D scene using Three.js.
- A simple chat command queue interface.
- Placeholder stubs for future Firebase and PayPal integrations.

The aim is to evolve this into a full open world where users can influence the main character (the "Soul") by queuing commands. Actions will persist using a database, and additional features like payment unlocking and AI-driven behaviors may be added in future versions.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (none required for the demo).
2. Open `public/index.html` in a modern browser.

Feel free to expand on this skeleton to build the full experience described in the Soul Drive specification.
